     x will make the most of your recordings and will bring out their full potential.

The increased quality of the recordings will likely lead to an increase in streams, sales, positive reviews, and more exposure in the industry.

    THE ART OF MIXING
As your mixing engineer, x will have the opportunity to:
    Take your song from being a promising rough mix to a mixed record that truly channels your vision and captures your emotions with a refreshing and assertive sound. 
    Make your song feels cohesive and musical, where each part of the arrangement plays its role without flaw. 
    Reveal the root conversation between the instruments in the arrangement and rediscover the song you envision.
    Create an all-in-one 3-dimensional feel in your song (height, width, and depth) that can transport the listener into a true listening experience of art.

Getting your new record mixed is similar to furnishing your new home. The rough mix of your song serves as the blueprint of the house that pecifies how many rooms, structure walls, and doorways are in it. The mixer is the interior designer who is hired to create an atmosphere that makes you feel at home and genuinely represents who you are as an artist.

As a mix engineer, Will seeks to complement the vision of the artist and take their sound to a level that is competitive with current record industry standards. His ultimate goal when working with any artist is that they leave the studio feeling that their artistic vision has been realized.


     350 euro / Track and up to 64 audio files (mono or stereo). Quoted rates are per track. Contact me if you have more than
                3 tracks to be mixed. All prices are exclusive of VAT.

                Work With me !
                After contacting me, I'll send you some information to export your tracks in the best quality. 
                You'll upload all them using wetransfr, dropbox or ...
                After receiving your files, I'll prepare the sessions, listen to your rough mix and go back to you with my first impression and idea.
                Then i'll mix your music. Sometimes you'll get work in progress if I need any help or directions. Otherwise you'll get the mix when I attack the last steps of my work. 
                At this point, all your comments are welcome.

                We can also meet to discuss about you rsong and the work I'll do.
