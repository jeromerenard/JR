    THE ART OF MIXING
As your mixing engineer, x will have the opportunity to:
    Take your song from being a promising rough mix to a mixed record that truly channels your vision and captures your emotions with a refreshing and assertive sound. 
    Make your song feels cohesive and musical, where each part of the arrangement plays its role without flaw. 
    Reveal the root conversation between the instruments in the arrangement and rediscover the song you envision.
    Create an all-in-one 3-dimensional feel in your song (height, width, and depth) that can transport the listener into a true listening experience of art.

Getting your new record mixed is similar to furnishing your new home. The rough mix of your song serves as the blueprint of the house that pecifies how many rooms, structure walls, and doorways are in it. The mixer is the interior designer who is hired to create an atmosphere that makes you feel at home and genuinely represents who you are as an artist.

As a mix engineer, Will seeks to complement the vision of the artist and take their sound to a level that is competitive with current record industry standards. His ultimate goal when working with any artist is that they leave the studio feeling that their artistic vision has been realized.
